This repository contains code that displays sprites stored in the assets folder. Main1 displays 20 random animal sprites in random locations. Main2 displays two different animals with dialog bubbles above their heads. Main3 causes the moose to follow the mouse around the screen. This all was created for assignment 4a for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University.
